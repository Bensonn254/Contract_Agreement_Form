## 🌐 HOW TO DEPLOY:

### Option 1: Netlify (EASIEST - Free)
1. Go to https://www.netlify.com/
2. Sign up (free)
3. Drag & drop both HTML files:
   - agreement-form-final.html
   - success.html
4. Get your URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
5. Share the link with clients!

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Create GitHub account
2. Create new repository
3. Upload both HTML files
4. Enable GitHub Pages in settings
5. Your URL: `https://username.github.io/repo-name`

### Option 3: Your Own Hosting
1. Upload both files to same folder
2. Access via your domain
3. Share the main form link

---

## 🔒 SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:

### ✅ Your Setup is Already Secure Because:
1. **EmailJS Public Keys are designed to be visible** - They're meant for frontend use
2. **Domain restriction** - You can limit which websites can use your keys in EmailJS dashboard
3. **No sensitive data exposed** - The keys don't give access to your Gmail directly

### 🛡️ Optional: Add Domain Restrictions
1. Go to EmailJS Dashboard
2. Click "Account" → "Security"
3. Add allowed domains (e.g., `yourwebsite.com`, `netlify.app`)
4. This prevents others from using your keys on different sites
